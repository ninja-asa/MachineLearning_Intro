Learning machine learning using Python (scikit) and the Pokedex.
1. Linear Regression - Ordinary Least Squares
	> Only doing linear regression (considering OLS) between the ATTACK and HP stats. 
	> **todo:** implement train/test split, perform linear regression between all combinations of stats, select top five combos relying on the mean sqr errors

2. (to be done)
